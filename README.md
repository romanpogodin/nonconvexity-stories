Research project of the [Yury Maximov's group](http://faculty.skoltech.ru/people/yurymaximov) at Skoltech.

# Test scripts
1. `algorithms_convergence*` -- runs all algorithms and record objective function values. Main script is '*_setup.m', it is used to avoid nested loops in parfor
# Functions
1. `solve_*` -- solvers for different approaches
2. Other functions are used in the solvers
