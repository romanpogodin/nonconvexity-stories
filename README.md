Research project of the [Yury Maximov's group](http://faculty.skoltech.ru/people/yurymaximov) at Skoltech.

# Test scripts
1. 'algorithms_convergence*' -- runs all algorithms and record objective function values. Main script is '*_setup.m', it is used to avoid nested loops in parfor
2. 'solve_*' -- solvers for different approaches
3. Other functions are used in the solvers
