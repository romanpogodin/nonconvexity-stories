Research project of the [Yury Maximov's group](http://faculty.skoltech.ru/people/yurymaximov) at Skoltech.

## Test scripts
1. `algorithms_convergence*` -- runs all algorithms and record objective function values. Main script is `*_setup.m`, it is used to avoid nested loops in parfor
## Functions
1. `solve_*` -- solvers for different approaches
2. Other functions are used in the solvers
## Data analysis
Jupyter notebook with some scripts for plotting
## Old code
An older version of solvers, kept here just in case
